# Update Tailwind CSS to Version 4 (2025-04-21 01:51:14)

_**User**_

@dashboard uses tailwind v3 right?

Can you update to v4, please?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the current Tailwind configuration and then help you with the update.

I need to inform you that there seems to be a misunderstanding. Currently, your project is using Tailwind CSS v3.3.3, but Tailwind CSS v4 has not been officially released yet. The latest stable version is v3.4.1 (as of March 2024).

Would you like me to update your Tailwind CSS to the latest v3.4.1 instead? This version includes several new features and improvements over v3.3.3, such as:
- Improved color palette
- New `text-wrap` utilities
- Logical property support improvements
- Better support for CSS nesting
- Various performance improvements

Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with updating to v3.4.1, or if you have any other questions!

I apologize for my earlier skepticism! You were absolutely right - Tailwind CSS v4.0 was released in January 2025, and v4.1 was just released in April 2025. Let me help you update to v4.1.

First, let me check your current package.json to see how we should update the dependencies:

---

Read file: /home/coding/peek-a-boo/apps/dashboard/package.json

---

I see you're currently using Tailwind CSS v3.3.3. Let's update to v4.1. Since you're using PostCSS, we'll need to update a few packages according to the v4.1 upgrade guide.

First, let me check your PostCSS config:

---

Read file: /home/coding/peek-a-boo/apps/dashboard/postcss.config.js

---

Let me help you update your configuration for Tailwind v4.1. I'll make the necessary changes:

1. First, let's update the PostCSS config to use the new v4 plugin structure:

---

```diff
  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
-     'tailwindcss': {},
-     'autoprefixer': {},
+     '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    },
  }; 
```

---

2. Now, let's update your package.json with the new dependencies:

---

```diff
    },
    "devDependencies": {
+     "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4.1.0",
      "@types/node": "^20.17.22",
      "@types/react": "^18.2.0",
      "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.0",
      "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^6.21.0",
      "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^6.21.0",
-     "autoprefixer": "10.4.16",
      "eslint": "^8.51.0",
      "eslint-config-next": "^14.0.0",
      "postcss": "8.4.31",
-     "tailwindcss": "3.3.3",
+     "tailwindcss": "^4.1.0",
      "typescript": "^5.2.2"
    }
```

---

3. Let's also check your Tailwind config to see if it needs updates:

---

Read file: /home/coding/peek-a-boo/apps/dashboard/tailwind.config.ts

---

Now I need to update your Tailwind configuration to use the new v4 CSS-first configuration approach. Let me create a new CSS file for your theme configuration:

I don't think we still need postcss! v4 seems seamless
