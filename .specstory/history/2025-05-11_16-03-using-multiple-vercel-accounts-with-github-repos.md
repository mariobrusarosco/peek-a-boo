# Using Multiple Vercel Accounts with GitHub Repos (2025-05-11 13:03:22)

_**User**_

Can I use my Vercel Account A with  my Github account, but for a specific repo, of this same accoint, i'd use a Vercel Account B?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can absolutely use different Vercel accounts for different repositories from the same GitHub account! This is a common setup and Vercel supports this workflow. Here's how it works:

## How Vercel Account Selection Works

1. **Per-Repository Basis**: Vercel deployments are configured on a per-repository basis, not per-GitHub account
2. **Manual Account Selection**: When importing a new repository to Vercel, you can choose which Vercel account to deploy it to
3. **Independent Management**: Each repository can be managed by a different Vercel account, even if they're all from the same GitHub account

## Setting This Up

### For New Repositories:
1. **Log into Vercel Account B** (the one you want to use for the specific repo)
2. **Import the repository** from your GitHub account
3. **Configure the project** in Vercel Account B
4. The repository will now be deployed and managed through Vercel Account B

### For Existing Repositories:
If the repository is already connected to Vercel Account A:
1. **Remove the project** from Vercel Account A (this won't delete your code)
2. **Log into Vercel Account B**
3. **Import the repository** again into Vercel Account B

## Important Considerations

### GitHub App Permissions
- Both Vercel accounts will need access to your GitHub repositories
- You may need to install the Vercel GitHub App for both accounts
- Make sure both Vercel accounts have the necessary permissions to access the specific repository

### Environment Variables & Secrets
- Environment variables are account-specific
- You'll need to configure them separately in each Vercel account
- Based on your Turborepo guide, make sure your `turbo.json` includes all necessary environment variables in the `env` array for the build task

### Domain Management
- Custom domains are managed per Vercel account
- If you're using custom domains, plan which account will manage which domains

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Your GitHub account has repos:
# - project-alpha (uses Vercel Account A)
# - project-beta (uses Vercel Account B)
# - project-gamma (uses Vercel Account A)
```

Each project can have completely different:
- Deployment settings
- Environment variables
- Team access (if using Vercel teams)
- Billing arrangements

This setup is particularly useful for:
- **Client work** (different clients, different Vercel accounts)
- **Personal vs. professional projects**
- **Different billing arrangements**
- **Team separation** (different teams managing different projects)

Would you like me to help you set up the specific repository with Vercel Account B, or do you need guidance on any particular aspect of this setup?

But how I make my repo to talk to vercel Account B instread of A?

_**Assistant**_

Great question! Here's exactly how to switch your repository from Vercel Account A to Vercel Account B:

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Remove the Project from Vercel Account A

1. **Log into Vercel Account A**
2. **Go to your dashboard** and find the project
3. **Click on the project** to open its settings
4. **Go to Settings â†’ General**
5. **Scroll down to "Delete Project"**
6. **Click "Delete"** and confirm

> **Important**: This only removes the Vercel project configuration. Your GitHub repository and code remain completely untouched.

### 2. Import the Repository to Vercel Account B

1. **Log out of Vercel Account A** (or use an incognito window)
2. **Log into Vercel Account B**
3. **Click "Add New..." â†’ Project**
4. **Import from GitHub** and select your repository
5. **Configure the project settings** for Account B

### 3. GitHub App Permissions (If Needed)

If Vercel Account B doesn't have access to your GitHub repositories:

1. **Go to GitHub Settings** â†’ Applications â†’ Installed GitHub Apps
2. **Find "Vercel"** in the list
3. **Click "Configure"**
4. **Grant access** to the specific repository or all repositories
5. **Or install the Vercel GitHub App** for Account B if it's not already installed

### 4. Reconfigure Environment Variables

Since environment variables are account-specific:

1. **In Vercel Account B**, go to your project settings
2. **Navigate to Environment Variables**
3. **Add all necessary environment variables** that were in Account A
4. **Make sure your `turbo.json` includes them** in the `env` array:

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "env": [
        "DATABASE_URL",
        "API_KEY", 
        "NEXTAUTH_URL",
        "NEXTAUTH_SECRET",
        "NODE_ENV"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Update Any Webhooks or Integrations

If you had any webhooks or third-party integrations:
- **Update webhook URLs** to point to the new Vercel deployment
- **Reconfigure any integrations** in Account B

## Alternative: Transfer Project (If Available)

Some Vercel plans allow project transfers:
1. **In Vercel Account A**, go to project Settings â†’ General
2. **Look for "Transfer Project"** option
3. **Transfer to Account B** (if this option is available)

## Verification

After the switch:
1. **Push a commit** to your GitHub repository
2. **Verify the deployment** triggers in Account B
3. **Check that environment variables** are working correctly
4. **Test your application** to ensure everything works

The key point is that **GitHub repositories are independent of Vercel accounts** - you're just changing which Vercel account is "listening" to and deploying your specific repository.

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of this process, such as setting up the environment variables in the new account?

But this is a global config on Github


---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! What you're seeing is the **global GitHub App installation** for Vercel, which gives Vercel access to your repositories at the GitHub level. This is indeed a global configuration.

However, the key point is that **having the GitHub App installed globally doesn't determine which Vercel account your repositories deploy to**. Here's how it actually works:

## How Vercel Account Selection Really Works

### 1. GitHub App Installation (What you're seeing)
- This is a **one-time global permission** that allows Vercel (as a platform) to access your GitHub repositories
- It doesn't tie your repos to any specific Vercel account
- Multiple Vercel accounts can use the same GitHub App installation

### 2. Project Import (Where account selection happens)
- When you **import a repository** into Vercel, you choose which Vercel account to import it into
- The same GitHub repository can be imported into different Vercel accounts
- Each Vercel account maintains its own separate project configuration

## The Process for Your Specific Case

Since you already have the Vercel GitHub App installed globally:

1. **Log into Vercel Account B**
2. **Click "Add New..." â†’ Project**
3. **You'll see all your GitHub repositories** (because of the global app permission)
4. **Import the specific repository** you want to move to Account B
5. **This creates a new project in Account B**, independent of Account A

## Important Notes

- **The global GitHub App installation stays as-is** - you don't need to change it
- **Repository access is shared** across all your Vercel accounts
- **Project configurations are account-specific** - each Vercel account has its own separate projects, deployments, and settings

So even though the GitHub integration appears "global," the actual deployment and project management happens at the individual Vercel account level when you import repositories.

Does this clarify how the repository-to-account assignment works despite the global GitHub App installation?

Nope! I can't make myself clear, but thanks

_**Assistant**_

No worries at all! I can tell I'm not quite understanding what you're trying to achieve or the specific issue you're facing.

Would you like to try explaining it a different way? Maybe you could:

- Describe the specific problem you're running into
- Share what you've already tried
- Or let me know what outcome you're hoping for

I'm here to help once I better understand what you need! ðŸ˜Š
