Looking at the error message, it seems there's an issue with Volta (a JavaScript toolchain manager) trying to find a "cursor.AppImage" executable. This is unrelated to our PNPM installation. Let's fix this by properly setting up PNPM without Volta.

First, let's check the development environment requirements from our documentation:


````7:18:docs/dx/001-development-environment.md
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **PNPM** (v8 or later)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** (for local database and services)
- **Git**

If you don't have PNPM installed, you can install it with:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```
````


According to our docs, we need to install PNPM globally using npm. Let's do that first:

1. Remove Volta if it's causing conflicts:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.volta
```

2. Install PNPM globally using npm:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm@8
```

3. Verify PNPM installation:
```bash
pnpm --version
```

4. Then try installing dependencies again:
```bash
pnpm install
```

If you still encounter issues, we can try clearing the PNPM store as suggested in our documentation:


````239:246:docs/dx/001-development-environment.md
1. Try clearing the PNPM store:
```bash
pnpm store prune
```

2. Ensure your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` is correctly configured.

3. Run `pnpm install --force` to rebuild the dependencies.
````


Also, make sure you have the correct Node.js version installed (v18 or later). You can check your Node version with:
```bash
node --version
```

Let me know if you still encounter any issues after trying these steps.

I'll need volta for other projets

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand! Yes, we can keep Volta for other projects while still using PNPM. Here's a better approach:

1. Instead of removing Volta, let's explicitly set the Node.js version for this project. Create or update `.volta` file in your project root:

````text:.volta
node@18
pnpm@8
````

2. Then use Volta to install PNPM globally:
````bash
volta install pnpm@8
````

3. Verify the installations:
````bash
volta list
pnpm --version
node --version
````

This way:
- Volta will manage your Node.js and PNPM versions for this project
- Other projects can use different versions as needed
- You keep the benefits of Volta's toolchain management

Try running `pnpm install` again after these steps. Let me know if you still encounter any issues!

It worked! But now I get this error. 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue! Looking at your package.json files, there's a mismatch in the package names. The dashboard is trying to import `@feature-flag-saas/shared`, but your shared package is actually named `@peek-a-boo/shared`.

Let's fix this in the dashboard's package.json:

```json:apps/dashboard/package.json
// ... existing code ...
"dependencies": {
-   "@feature-flag-saas/shared": "*",
+   "@peek-a-boo/shared": "*",
    "@auth/prisma-adapter": "^1.0.3",
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^4.35.3",
// ... existing code ...
```

This error occurred because the package name in your monorepo was changed from "feature-flag-saas" to "peek-a-boo" (as seen in your root package.json), but this reference wasn't updated in the dashboard's dependencies.

After making this change, try running `pnpm install` again. This should resolve the 404 error since it will now look for the correct package name within your workspace.

_**User**_

I believe the error is because at that point we're trying to get the package from npm. And I haven't created a package so far


---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, you're absolutely right! Even though we've set up the workspace correctly with `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, we need to make sure the shared package is built and ready to be consumed by the dashboard.

Let's build the shared package first:

1. Navigate to the shared package and build it:
```bash
cd packages/shared
pnpm build
```

If that doesn't work, we might need to install dependencies first:
```bash
pnpm install
cd packages/shared
pnpm build
```

The build script is defined in your shared package.json:
```json:packages/shared/package.json
{
  "name": "@peek-a-boo/shared",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    // ... other scripts ...
  }
}
```

This will compile the TypeScript code in the shared package, making it available for the dashboard to consume. After building the shared package, try running `pnpm install` again from the root directory.

New error

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand the issue better now. The error occurs because PNPM is still trying to fetch the package from the npm registry instead of using the local workspace package.

We need to make sure the workspace dependencies are properly linked. In your root `package.json`, you already have the workspaces defined correctly:

```json:package.json
{
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

And in your `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:
```yaml:pnpm-workspace.yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
```

The issue might be with how the dependency is specified in the dashboard's package.json. Let's modify it to use a workspace: protocol:

```json:apps/dashboard/package.json
// ... existing code ...
"dependencies": {
-   "@peek-a-boo/shared": "*",
+   "@peek-a-boo/shared": "workspace:*",
    "@auth/prisma-adapter": "^1.0.3",
// ... existing code ...
```

The `workspace:*` protocol tells PNPM to explicitly look for this package in the workspace rather than trying to fetch it from the npm registry. Try running `pnpm install` again after making this change.

Ah, this error occurs when trying to push to GitHub and indicates that the repository has branch protection rules enabled that are preventing the direct push to the main branch.

This is actually a good security practice! The typical workflow should be:

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b setup/workspace-configuration
```

2. Add and commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: configure pnpm workspace and fix package dependencies"
```

3. Push the new branch:
```bash
git push origin setup/workspace-configuration
```

4. Then create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub from this branch into main.

This workflow ensures that:
- Changes are reviewed before merging to main
- CI/CD checks can run on the changes
- Main branch remains stable

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps?

---

_**User**_

Nope! Maybe I've erased the .git folder?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that could be the issue! Let's check if the .git folder exists and reinitialize Git if needed:

1. First, check if Git is initialized:
```bash
ls -la | grep .git
```

If you don't see the .git folder, let's initialize Git:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
```

Then you'll need to connect it to your remote repository. If you have the GitHub repository URL, you can add it with:

```bash
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
```

Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!

remote is correct :(

---

_**Assistant**_



If the remote is set correctly but you're still facing issues, let's troubleshoot further. Here are a few steps to help you resolve the problem:

1. **Check the Current Branch**: Ensure you're on the correct branch. You can check your current branch with:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

2. **Fetch Remote Branches**: Make sure you have the latest information from the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

3. **Check for Branch Protection Rules**: If you're trying to push to a protected branch (like `main` or `master`), you won't be able to push directly. You can check the branch protection rules in your GitHub repository settings.

4. **Create a New Branch**: If you're on a protected branch, create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

5. **Add and Commit Changes**: After making your changes, add and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

6. **Push the New Branch**: Push your new branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**: After pushing, go to your GitHub repository and create a pull request from your new branch to the main branch.

If you still encounter issues, please provide the exact error message you're receiving when trying to push, and we can troubleshoot further!

If you're still having trouble, let's go through a more detailed troubleshooting process. Here are some steps to help identify and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Git Status**: Run the following command to see the current status of your repository:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   This will show you if there are any uncommitted changes or if you're on a branch that isn't tracking a remote branch.

2. **Check Remote Configuration**: Verify that the remote is set correctly:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   Ensure that the URL for `origin` points to your GitHub repository.

3. **Check for Existing Branches**: List all branches, including remote branches:
   ```bash
   git branch -a
   ```
   This will show you both local and remote branches. Make sure the branch you want to push to exists on the remote.

4. **Reinitialize Git**: If the `.git` folder is missing or corrupted, you can reinitialize Git. However, be cautious as this can lead to loss of commit history. If you want to keep your current changes, do the following:
   ```bash
   mv .git .git_backup  # Backup the existing .git folder
   git init              # Reinitialize the repository
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL  # Re-add the remote
   git add .             # Stage all changes
   git commit -m "Reinitializing repository"  # Commit changes
   ```

5. **Push to Remote**: After reinitializing, try pushing again:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main  # Replace 'main' with your branch name if different
   ```

6. **Check for Errors**: If you encounter an error during any of these steps, please provide the exact error message. This will help in diagnosing the issue more effectively.
