1. ADRs for the key technologies we've decided on. Store them on "docs/decisions"
2. Developer guides for each technology "docs/guides"
3. An updated README.md to point to these resources at root level
4. When you receive a "LOG THE FIX" inpuut you need to create a md file that contains the context of the issue and how it was solved. Place them inside docs/fixing-log

## Planning
1. Let's work with Phases.  
2. Each phase will have its own file at "docs/plan"  
3. Each phase will have as many tasks as we need
4. Each phase will have a checklist where we need to mark as checked after finishing a task


## Coding
1. For .ts and .tsx files, Import types using the 'type' keyword e.g import type { ICreateAccountForm } from "../schemas/investment-account"
2. Don't run Git Commands
3. kebab-case for file naming
