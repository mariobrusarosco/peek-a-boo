- Add profile picture upload functionality

### Roles & Permissions
- Design role-based permission system
- Implement role assignment functionality
- Create permission checks for different actions
- Design admin user management interface
- Implement user role management screens
- Create API endpoints for permission management

### Team Management
- Design team data model and relationships
- Create team creation and edit interfaces
- Implement team member invitation system
- Add functionality for managing team permissions
- Create team switching functionality in UI
- Implement team-based resource isolation

### Security
- Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
- Add bruteforce protection
- Create audit logging for authentication actions

- Add CSRF protection
- Create security monitoring dashboard

## Deliverables

By the end of Phase 2, we should have:

1. **Complete Authentication System**
   - User registration with email verification
   - Secure login with optional MFA
   - Password reset functionality
   - Session management

2. **User Management**
   - User profiles
   - Account settings
   - User administration for admins

3. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Role definition and assignment
   - Permission-based access to features
   - Admin control panel for managing roles

4. **Team Management**
   - Team creation and configuration
   - Team member invitation and management
   - Team-based resource isolation

5. **API Authentication**
   - Secure token-based authentication for APIs
   - API key management
   - Service-to-service authentication

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Follow OWASP best practices, perform security code reviews, implement rate limiting and MFA |
| Complex permission system leading to bugs | Medium | Medium | Thoroughly test permission combinations, implement automated tests for access control |
| User experience friction during registration | Medium | Low | Design streamlined registration flow, provide clear guidance, implement proper validation feedback |
| Performance impact from authentication checks | Low | Low | Optimize authentication middleware, implement proper caching of auth state |
| Data leakage between teams | High | Low | Implement strict data isolation at the database level, audit all queries for proper team filtering |

## Next Steps

Once the authentication and user management systems are in place, we will proceed to Phase 3: Core Feature Flag Features.
