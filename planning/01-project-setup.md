## Deliverables

By the end of Phase 1, we will have:

1. A functioning development environment
2. Monorepo structure with Next.js dashboard and NestJS SDK service
3. Database schema and migrations
4. Basic CI/CD pipeline
5. Deployed skeleton applications
6. Comprehensive documentation

## Dependencies

- Database schema design (impacts all applications)
- Shared package implementation (used by both dashboard and SDK service)
- Environment configuration (needed for local development and deployment)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complex monorepo setup | Medium | Medium | Clear documentation, consistent patterns |
| Database schema changes | High | Medium | Careful design, use of migrations |
| Environment config issues | Medium | High | Standardized .env files, documentation |
| Deployment complexities | Medium | Medium | Start with simple deployments, then enhance |

## Next Steps

Once Phase 1 is complete, we will move on to [Phase 2: Authentication & User Management](./02-authentication.md).
