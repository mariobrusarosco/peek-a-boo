## Dependencies and Critical Path

The development follows a sequential path with each phase building on the previous one. Critical path items include:

- Database schema design (impacts all phases)
- Authentication system (required for feature flag management)
- WebSocket infrastructure (required for real-time updates)
- SDK design (impacts client integration experience)

## Risk Management

Key risks and mitigation strategies are documented in each phase plan. Overall project risks include:

1. **Technical Complexity** - The hybrid architecture with Next.js and NestJS requires careful coordination
2. **Performance Challenges** - Real-time updates at scale may require optimization
3. **Security Considerations** - Feature flags control application behavior, requiring robust security
