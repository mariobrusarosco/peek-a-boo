   - Subscription management
   - Event persistence and replay
   - Filtering and routing

3. **Real-time Dashboard Updates**
   - Live updates of flag statuses
   - Collaborative editing indicators
   - User presence functionality
   - Activity feed with real-time updates

4. **WebSocket Client Library**
   - Connection management with authentication
   - Event handling and filtering
   - Robust reconnection logic
   - Compatibility with various environments

5. **Performance & Scaling**
   - Horizontal scaling capability
   - Load balancing for connections
   - Performance monitoring
   - Optimized message handling

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WebSocket connection stability | High | Medium | Implement robust reconnection logic, provide HTTP polling fallback |
| Scaling challenges with many connections | High | Medium | Use Redis adapter for Socket.io, implement horizontal scaling, conduct load testing |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Implement token-based authentication, rate limiting, and connection validation |
| Client compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Test across different browsers and environments, provide fallback mechanisms |
| Performance degradation with high message volume | High | Low | Implement message batching, optimize serialization, use efficient data structures |

## Next Steps

Once the real-time updates functionality is implemented, we will proceed to Phase 5: Client SDK & Integration.
