## Detailed Tasks

### Flag Management
- Design database schema for feature flags
- Create flag creation interface with validation
- Implement flag toggle and edit functionality
- Build flag listing/filtering dashboard
- Create flag archiving and deletion functionality
- Implement flag search capabilities

### Flag Types & Variations
- Implement boolean flag type (on/off)
- Create string flag type with multiple variations
- Implement number flag type with validation
- Create JSON flag type with editor
- Build variation management interface
- Implement default value handling

### Environments
- Design environment data model
- Create environment management screens
- Implement environment-specific flag values
- Build environment cloning functionality
- Create environment variables/configuration
- Implement environment access controls

### Targeting Rules
- Design rule engine data model
- Create targeting rule builder interface
- Implement user targeting capabilities
- Build percentage rollout functionality
- Create attribute-based targeting
- Implement complex boolean logic for rules
- Design and implement scheduling for flags

### Flag Evaluation
- Create core evaluation engine
- Implement rule evaluation logic
- Build caching mechanism for evaluations
- Create override capability for testing
- Implement evaluation logging
- Design evaluation API endpoints

### Project Structure
- Implement project creation and management
- Create project settings interface
- Build project-based access control
- Implement resource organization by project
- Create cross-project flag references

## Deliverables

By the end of Phase 3, we should have:

1. **Complete Flag Management System**
   - Flag creation, editing, toggling, archiving
   - Support for different flag types (boolean, string, number, JSON)
   - Flag search and filtering

2. **Environment Support**
   - Environment configuration
   - Environment-specific flag values
   - Environment cloning and management

3. **Advanced Targeting**
   - User targeting capabilities
   - Attribute-based rules
   - Percentage rollouts
   - Scheduled activations

4. **Flag Evaluation Engine**
   - Fast, accurate rule evaluation
   - Default value handling
   - Evaluation logging
   - Override capability

5. **Organization Structure**
   - Project-based organization
   - Resource management
   - Cross-project capabilities

6. **Complete API**
   - RESTful API for all flag operations
   - Well-documented endpoints
   - Secure access controls

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complex targeting rules affecting performance | High | Medium | Optimize rule evaluation, implement caching, conduct performance testing |
| Database schema limitations | Medium | Medium | Design extensible schema with migration path, use NoSQL for rule storage |
| UI complexity for rule builder | Medium | High | User testing early in development, iterative UX improvements |
| Scalability issues with large number of flags | High | Low | Implement pagination, efficient queries, and indexes |
| Data consistency across environments | Medium | Medium | Implement transaction support, validation, and conflict resolution |

## Next Steps

Once the core feature flag functionality is implemented, we will proceed to Phase 4: Real-time Updates & WebSockets.
