## üöÄ Quick Deployment

### Dashboard (Vercel)
```bash
# Build locally first
pnpm build:dashboard

# Deploy via Vercel CLI
pnpm deploy:dashboard
```

### SDK Service (Railway)
```bash
# Build locally first
pnpm build:sdk-service

# Deploy via Railway CLI
pnpm deploy:sdk-service
```

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations ready
- [ ] Build succeeds locally
- [ ] Security review complete

### Dashboard (Vercel)
- [ ] Vercel project created
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Domain configured
- [ ] Build settings verified
- [ ] Deploy and test

### SDK Service (Railway)
- [ ] Railway project created
- [ ] Database connected (Supabase)
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Port configuration verified
- [ ] Deploy and test

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] APIs responding correctly
- [ ] WebSocket connections working
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors

## üåç Deployment Targets

| Service | Platform | URL Pattern |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Vercel | `https://peek-a-boo-dashboard.vercel.app` |
| **SDK Service** | Railway | `https://sdk-service.up.railway.app` |
| **Database** | Supabase | Connection via DATABASE_URL |

## üîê Environment Variables

### Critical Variables
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=           # Supabase connection string
DATABASE_DIRECT_URL=    # Supabase direct connection

# Dashboard
NEXTAUTH_URL=           # Dashboard URL
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=        # Auth secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_SDK_SERVICE_URL=  # SDK Service URL

# SDK Service
PORT=                   # Railway assigns this
DATABASE_URL=           # Same as above
```

See [Environment Variables Guide](../02-setup/environment-variables.md) for complete list.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Build order matters**: Always build `core` first
2. **Monorepo considerations**: Vercel and Railway need special config
3. **Database migrations**: Run before deploying new code
4. **Environment variables**: Different for prod vs dev
5. **Port configuration**: Dashboard (3000), SDK Service (6001/dynamic)

## üîß Troubleshooting

Common issues:
- Build failures ‚Üí Check `turbo.json` env array
- Module not found ‚Üí Rebuild core package
- Database connection ‚Üí Check DATABASE_URL
- API timeouts ‚Üí Check Railway/Vercel logs

For detailed troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Guide](../06-troubleshooting/).
