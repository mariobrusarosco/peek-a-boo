# Vercel Deployment Fixes - March 12, 2024

## Issue Description

The Vercel deployment was failing due to several TypeScript errors:

1. Missing UI component imports in the login page
2. Incorrect Prisma client imports
3. Next.js route type generation issues

## Root Cause Analysis

1. UI Components:

   - The UI components were being imported from `@/components/ui` but were actually located in `@/domains/ui-system/components/ui`
   - Some UI components were missing and needed to be created (card, label, checkbox, alert)

2. Prisma Client:

   - The code was trying to import from `@peek-a-boo/shared/node_modules/.prisma/client` instead of `@prisma/client`
   - This was causing TypeScript to fail to find the type declarations

3. Next.js Route Types:
   - Next.js was trying to generate types for a non-existent `[slug]` route
   - The TypeScript configuration needed to be updated to handle Next.js type generation correctly

## Solution

1. UI Components:

   - Updated import paths in `login/page.tsx` to use the correct path
   - Created missing UI components:
     - `card.tsx`
     - `label.tsx`
     - `checkbox.tsx`
     - `alert.tsx`
   - Installed required Radix UI dependencies:
     - `@radix-ui/react-label`
     - `@radix-ui/react-checkbox`

2. Prisma Client:

   - Updated all Prisma client imports to use `@prisma/client` directly
   - This ensures proper type resolution and better compatibility

3. Next.js Configuration:
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` to properly handle Next.js type generation
   - Fixed the build script in `package.json` to use the correct path to Next.js

## Verification

The build now completes successfully with no TypeScript errors. The deployment should now work correctly on Vercel.

## Lessons Learned

1. Always maintain consistent import paths across the codebase
2. Use direct imports from workspace dependencies rather than nested node_modules paths
3. Keep the TypeScript configuration in sync with Next.js requirements
4. Document UI component locations and dependencies clearly
